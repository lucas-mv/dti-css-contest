# dti-css-contest
My entry for the first dti css contest!

This was a very interesting project to work on, the idea of the contest was to "do something cool using CSS only" and I had a lot of fun doing it!

I used Angular to develop but just to kickstart the project and to make it easier to develop with the automatic `SASS` refresh that `ng serve` provides, all the code is basically `HTML` and `SASS`.

I call this one `roadtrippin'` and I really wanted to portrait a peaceful roadtrip to the beach!
